Are you still mad at me?
…
Thank you, I know sometimes I can be a bit much. I’m sorry. I promise I’m going to be doing that thinking thing a lot more. 
…
You are the best. I really don’t deserve a friend like you. You’re so amazing! Really. I don’t say it enough. You’re smart, you’re funny, you’re beautiful, you have this way of moving through the world that leaves an impact on everyone you meet.
You’re outlook on life is something that inspires me and you brighten the room everywhere you go. You’re literally one of the most incredible people I’ve ever met. He’s lying. I’m so proud to call you my friend.
…
Why? It’s all true, you know.
…
If you keep going like this, you will chase them off. You will make yourself unloveable. This is not who you are. 
…
…
Is everything okay? You just had a weird look on your face.
…
Oh, okay, I blank out ALL the time. I’ll sit there and just stare at something and not even be seeing it. It’s the worst when it’s people.
…
I mean, maybe I look like a serial killer, but...yeah no never mind, I definitely look like a serial killer when I do that. But isn’t the whole point of being a serial killer that you don’t look like one?
Like you can never really know what’s going on in someone’s head. You can never really know someone. For all I know you’re batshit crazy! But I would never know, I mean, unless you decided to kill me.
…
Shit, am I not doing the thing where I think before I speak?
…
You are better than this. Temptation is everywhere. But you know better, don’t you?
…
…
I mean. If I can say one thing, and you HAVE to trust me, it’s that I’m not a serial killer. Scouts honor. Though if I was, maybe I’ve been waiting all these years to kill you.
But you’re no good to me now, not if you keep not eating like this. I need you big and plump so I can put you into my oven! Then I can feast on your bones!
…
Oh god, that WAS creepy and weird wasn’t it? Your insult is noted. But what if I was telling the truth?
…
So eat up! I can’t have you so skinny or you’ll cook too fast. Yeah, I’m definitely not a serial killer.
…
…
I swear I’m kidding, I mean, I know sometimes I can be a creep, but I’m not THAT creepy.
…
You don’t seem convinced!
…
I guess you’ll just never know, mwahahahahahaha.
I’m trying to choose my next victim
