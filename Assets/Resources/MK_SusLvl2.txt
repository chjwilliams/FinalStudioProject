Was that not incredible? I mean that bear was so close to the tent. If we had been out there when he got there, it may have been the end of us!
…
I mean I guess. Maybe you could have jumped on my shoulders and we could have scared him off. Booga booga booga!
…
Excuse me, that would have been terrifying. It would have scarred the bear for life! He would have gone home to his little bear friends and been like “I saw the craziest thing.”
…
Haha, no YOU’RE the craziest thing. Seriously! Sometimes you’re just so weird. Like here we are that this amazing restaurant and you’ve barely touched your food.
It reminds me of one of those kids who just cannot stand the idea of their food touching. You’ve always been such a picky eater. Is it the restaurant? I should cook for you sometime. I am a master chef, and I can cook you a meal that will blow your mind.
…
Are you sure? Okay, that’s fine. Maybe we can do something else.
…
Actually you’ve never eaten my food before now that I think about it. Why do you hate me?
…
…
It’s probably for the best that you don’t eat my cooking. I could actually be awful at it. Like most things that I end up doing.
…
I know, it’s just that sometimes I feel like I’m incapable of doing anything right. I’m at this awful job, I can’t find anyone who will love me, my life is just so boring right now and no matter how hard I try I can’t seem to find a way out of this rut. 
…
I mean, please, tell me. What is it about me that seems to upset so many people? I just have to assume the people are jealous of me. I’m smart, I’m good looking, I’m capable, I’ve saved up some money. People just want what I have. But then why am I so bored all the time.
I need to find a good woman. That what it is. I need someone exciting, someone who can show me everything and teach me what I don’t know. I need a woman who can take care of things.
…
What? What does that even mean? I don’t want a mother.
…
I want a woman who can drink beer, watch sports, be one of the guys. Those are the best kind of women because they’ve stopped caring about acting like a woman and just started exploring more that life has to offer. Yeah, that’s exactly what I need.
…
…
Why are you looking at me like that? I mean, what kind of woman wouldn’t want to be with someone like me? I’m nice, I’m respectful, I’m a feminist!
I’m literally the kind of guy that women dream they can be with. I mean, you look at some of these Hollywood types and so many of them are just clueless materialist idiots. I need a down-to-earth girl. 
… 28
What?! I’m not like that at all. Why would you say that to me? Jesus Christ...
…
I want a girl who doesn’t act like a girl. Someone I can just hang out with and be cool with, crack jokes, have intelligent conversation.
…
…
Okay, listen, I’m not sure exactly what pissed you off, but I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to go throw a pity-party for myself. Sometimes it just happens. 
…
Haha, I guess I should try to think before I speak more often. It would probably save myself a lot of hassle.
…
Oh, I like that, okay new rule. I’m going to NOT say anything unless I’ve thought very hard about it. 
Hold on, I’m thinking
