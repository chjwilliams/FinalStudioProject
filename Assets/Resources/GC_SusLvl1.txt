I’m so happy you finally got a chance to come out with us! We’ve all really missed you
…
No worries, I completely understand, how is that new job going? It must be exciting working for a non-profit.
…
Oh! You didn’t mention that it was Planned Parenthood. I mean, don’t you think there are better organizations you can work for? There are real issues out there that need people to support them. 
I mean, as a parent, I think that every child’s life is sacred, and abortion just seems irresponsible. You have to think of the children.
…
Oh, okay, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to upset you. I’m sure the work you’ll do there will help a lot of people.
…
I just don’t get it. Candice is happy at home, she’s happy doing the cooking, the cleaning, taking care of the kid, this whole feminist movement seems like a step in the wrong direction.
…
…
I’m sorry, I’m breaking Candice’s cardinal rule: No work talk at the dinner table!
…
Oh my god, I know. Time is flying by so fast. It seems like yesterday she was barely an idea, and now she’s a crawling, babbling, wonderful little flower. I feel blessed every day.
…
She is beautiful. And if Candice’s genes are as strong as her family says they are, this little darling will grow up just as beautiful as her mother.
Not to say that I won’t think she’s beautiful no matter what, but I mean, it’s probably not a very satisfying life being a behemoth. 
Candice keeps giving her all this food, and feeding her all the time, I just want her to grow up and live a perfectly normal life. 
Not like these people on this show that Candace keeps watching, the Biggest Loser? The Fattest Lost? Something, but these people go on the show and they’re HUGE.
…
Well like I said, no matter what she’s gonna be beautiful, and I’ll do everything I can to make sure she lives a happy life.
…
I mean, it’s simple biology. You can’t be that big and survive. Evolution has crafted the body as a perfect machine, and these people out there are destroying themselves. I won’t let that happen to my daughter.
…
…
Really this is why exercise is so important. If people would just exercise more, people wouldn’t have so many issues. I feel like every other day I hear about something new that someone is complaining about. 
There’s too many carbs, too much gluten, diabetes is on the rise, obesity is now a disease, but if they just took the time to actually take care of their bodies, then maybe they’d be happier and live more fulfilled in their lives.
…
I agree with you, I’m not really accounting for the impact of culture on our perception of health, it just seems like neither side of the argument can really satisfy me.
…
Like, I get it, I’ve been sad before, I’ve had problems, but I just got up and got over it. I exercised, I felt better, I DID better. Why can’t other people just do it? Happiness and health are choices that you can make. 
…
…
Speaking of exercise! Did you see the new Marvel movie? Chris Christhers looked amazing in it! I can’t wait for the sequel.
…
What?! No, I liked the movie so much better than the comic series. It really got to the core of what it means to be a hero.
…
I mean, maybe, but I feel like if they added in that storyline it would make the movie too political and would ostracize a large part of the audience. 
…
Absolutely, hold on a second, I’m getting a text.
Hold on, I’m almost done with this text.
