Okay, so I’ve chosen my next victim.
…
No! I’m not serious, I’m just trying to lighten the mood.
…
Do I sense a bit of sarcasm there?
…
I mean, it would make sense. Something has seemed off the entire night. I don’t know what’s happening, if it’s this whole table, this restaurant, the stars aren’t aligned, or what.
But this whole night has been a little tense. What are you holding onto so tightly? Why won’t you let go? Have you noticed it at all? Or is it just me? I could swear I’m not making this up. 
…
Yeah, I don’t know what it is either, it’s the weirdest thing
…
Let go. Let me help you. Why won’t you let me help you.
…
…
It’s probably nothing. Or maybe it’s the end of the world. Maybe everybody is tapping into the ether and sensing their inevitable doom.
…
I know, I don’t know when it got so dark. I used to have such an innocent sense of humor. 
…
I mean, but that’s what I’m talking about. Tonight HAS been weird. You’ve all been kind of treating me like I was some disgusting animal. Like, I was sitting here with leprosy or something. 
It seems like I can’t say anything at all without someone telling me I’m being weird, or insensitive, or just wrong somehow. Even you! I just don’t understand what’s happening. 
…
Am I really coming off that way? I’m not trying to throw a pity party or make myself a victim...
…
It’s like, I can’t even make a joke anymore. Nobody seems to want me here. Like, I love you all, but you’re all acting like you hate me.
…
…
I just want you all to like me. I thought me and you had so much in common, we were the warriors against the patriarchy, we were the smart ones, but now it just seems like everybody thinks I’m an obnoxious joke.
It gets frustrating and I don’t know what’s wrong with everybody that’s making them act this way.
…
Shit...really? I haven’t been meaning to act like a jerk...I...I don’t know what to do.
…
I’m being exactly the same as I’ve always been, and no one ever had a problem with me. And now all the sudden everybody is ganging up on me.
…
…
I don’t MEAN to be an asshole. I don’t know what to do.
…
Ha, I guess shutting up would help once in a while.
…
I’ll try to be better. Next time we meet up for a dinner like this I’ll be better I promise. I won’t let you down. 
I can’t believe I’m such an asshole...
