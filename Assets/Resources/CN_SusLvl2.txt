Isn’t it adorable? I can put all my wine in this and never have to worry about an open bottle going bad.
…
You’re telling me. I’m so glad that I’m done breastfeeding, I can finally get that drink on again.
…
Well, it’d be nice if there was a book club or something, so I could drink with some friends. The baby doesn’t make the best drinking buddy.
…
Please, there’s no way I’m gonna develop any problems, I can’t believe you’d even ask that!
…
Well I was thinking the same thing actually. Are you sure everything’s okay with YOU. You’ve been a little off all night. If something is wrong you have to tell me about it. Is it work? Is it a special someone? Is it your mom again?
I can’t believe you aren’t telling me about the things in your life you’re such a bad friend. You know I’d tell you anything.
…
Yeah, I know I can trust you. I’m probably just chasing shadows.
…
You know, ever since what me and Giancarlo went through, I’ve read a lot, and open communication is key. You should always tell the people you love about the things in your life. You’re a liar.
…
…
I know, that was such a hard time for us. But we’ve gotten a lot better because of it. I actually feel like this is a marriage now! He’s so open and honest about everything he thinks and feels.
…
Oh don’t start that up again! I like marriage. I know it’s history, blah blah blah patriarchy. But marriage is about LOVE. Don’t be such a cynic. You just haven’t met the right person.
…
Well tell that to me on your wedding day, when you’re in your beautiful white dress, in front of all your friends and family. Every eye looking at you thinking “my god she’s beautiful” and everyone ready to watch you start your life.
They’ll all want to hug you and congratulate you, and then the dance, and the cake. Oh my god the cake! You get to have the first huge slice in front of everyone, maybe even do that cute thing where you feed your partner.
…
Well fine, maybe marriage isn’t for you!
…
And ugh, the dress. Wait till you go shopping for that dress. It’ll be a nightmare, but SO worth it. You’ll be lucky because I’m sure you’ll fit into anything you put on. Not like me, I had to drop a few pounds to get into my dress. 
…
…
Are you sure everything is okay? You’re not upset at me for liking marriage are you?
I mean, you seemed to always want to help me and Giancarlo through our problems, you were always so supportive. It doesn’t seem fair for me to not be able to talk about this to you, my best friend.
…
Oh my god, I’m so sorry. I got lost there for a moment. No of course! I love you. I didn’t mean to accuse you of anything.
…
All the books tell me that I’m supposed to say exactly what I’m feeling, and I’m sorry if it upsets you, but that’s just the way it is.
…
…
Where is that waiter? I could go for a refill right about now. I’m like a fish out of water!
…
Maybe, but you’d think they would send another person over if that was the case.
…
Oh my god, I had completely forgotten about that! No last call, the kitchen would always be open.What were we going to call it? I swear it’s right on the tip of my tongue.
Oh my god, how could I forget this? Just give me a second, I almost have it.
