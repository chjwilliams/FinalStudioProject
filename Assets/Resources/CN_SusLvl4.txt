So, anything else interesting happening in your life right now?
…
I mean, it can’t be that boring! Are you sure there’s not something going on?
…
No no, I’m not trying to do anything! I’m just asking.
…
I mean, okay, FINE. I am a little worried. You’ve barely touched your food at all. Are you sick? I just hope you don’t feel like you have to hide anything from me. We could have totally rescheduled.
You know this restaurant isn’t the best one I’ve ever been too. You would think That you are a glutton, a disappointment, a worm, a spoiled fruit. That they don’t love you.  I mean at least I think so.
…
Okay...if you say so...
…
You will crawl back when it’s over,  like you always do. Ask me to make you beautiful. 
…
…
I’m sorry, I couldn’t hear you. Are you shaking?
…
Oh okay, yeah I get those all the time, they’re nothing to worry about. I really miss us hanging out like this.
…
You’ve always been such an important person my life. If it weren’t for you, I don’t know what would have happened between me and Gianny. I just wish I could repay the favor. It’s probably why I’m a little worried right now. 
I know that this job is a lot, and I know that things haven’t always been easy for you. Come back to me, I’ll kiss your wounds. But you always have friends that love you. 
…
Okay. I know you know. I just wanted to say it again.
…
You need me. You will always need me. 
…
…
I’m sorry, I have to keep saying it, but I am always here for you. I know that may be hard for you to believe. I don’t know what’s going on, but I promise I will always support you no matter what. You’re my best friend and I will never abandon you.
I will force you to your knees. Fingers down your throat. Bring it back up until your heart beats out your chest. I just needed to say that. I need to make sure you know that.
…
If you say so, I’m here if you’re ever ready to talk.
…
Beg me. I want you to beg me
…
…
Okay, I promise, I’ll stop. Mouth shut! Zipped tight. Pinky promise. 
…
Oh my god, I can’t believe how much time has gone by. The night is almost over!
…
I need to start thinking about how to get home. I wonder if Uber will pick me and Gianny up.
Oh my god, how are there no Uber drivers available? Refresh!
