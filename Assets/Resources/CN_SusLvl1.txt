Finally we get a chance to talk! It feels like it’s been forever, I’ve missed you so much.
…
I know, it’s tough. But hey, I mean, if there was ever gonna be reason to not be in touch as often it’s because we’re both so busy with life!
…
The little one is kind of the only friend I have right now. I haven’t had a chance to meet many people in the new neighborhood. 
…
Well I spend a lot of time taking care of the baby, but I also spend a lot of time, probably too much time, watching the food network and The Biggest Loser.
I try to curb my desire to eat everything with my goal of getting back to my pre-baby weight. I just can’t stand looking like I do right now with all these stretch marks. I feel like a whale, and I want to be comfortable again.
…
No! I haven’t found anything else on TV that I’m really interested in. Oh, that’s a lie, I’ve been obsessed with that new Marvel show starring Chris Christhers.
…
Like you, you’re so pretty, and you always look so healthy. I wish I could have a body like yours. I wish I had your willpower. I don’t know how you do it, you look like a movie star.
…
…
Oh I bet the money must be so good. I’m feeling pretty happy about the money Gianny is making. It gives us both enough room to buy what we want and save a little money.
…
I haven’t bought anything YET, but I’m saving up to buy a nice guitar for myself. I figure I could teach myself and maybe one day teach our little pumpkin how to play it!
…
Right? A mother/daughter musical extravaganza! Oh! Maybe she can meet a nice boy that way.
…
I mean, I want grandkids one day. So hopefully she’ll meet a nice boy, marry him, have kids, and keep our memory alive. It seems weird that so many people don’t want that anymore. Like I don’t get it, do they not like me or my family?
It seems like people are really getting upset at the whole idea of “traditional.” It feels like they’re trying to infringe on an institution that has been around since forever.
…
Of course I’ll love her no matter what. And maybe you’re right, it just feels like the way people talk about it I’m always the villain no matter what.
…
People just need to stop complaining and realize that life is hard. My family hasn’t had it the easiest either, my life hasn’t been perfect, but I’m not complaining. People need to grow a pair of balls and take control of their lives.
…
…
Yeah, but people for the most part are stupid. I don’t want to raise my daughter to be an idiot.
And to be honest, and I know I can tell you this because you’re such a good friend, but I feel like if I send her to public school with just everyone else then she’s going to end up like all these girls I see on TV who make the worst choices and end up with bad men.
…
Oh, I didn’t know you went to public school! Maybe I’ll have to rethink this a bit and do some more research, because you’re definitely a good result.
…
If she gets exposed to all these bad parts of the world, then who knows what she’ll end up doing. She could end up fat, pregnant, poor, suffering from who knows what diseases. Nope, not happening.
…
…
But that’s all a few years away, for now she all she can do is shit and piss! I’m going to need a drink for that one.
…
Alcohol is like holy water, it gets rid of all the bad things in life.
…
Oh, I’m definitely a wine-mom now. In fact, let me show you this really cute wine cooler I want to buy
Give me a sec, I almost pulled it up but the internet is awful here.
