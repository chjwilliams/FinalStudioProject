Again, I’m so sorry about that. I know it’s rude, but I’m really invested in this game. So talk to me, what’s going on in your life?
…
That’s awesome. And the people you work with are okay? Boss treating you find?
…
No! I believe you! I’m just making sure things are okay. You’ve seemed off this entire time and I just figured something was wrong.
…
I’m just trying to be supportive. If I did anything wrong, you know you can tell me. Are you upset about the whole “not telling Candace about the bet” thing? I mean, I’ll make sure to tell her before dinner is even up!
I’d just like if you could open up to me like you used to. It seems like things have changed and I don’t know what’s going on, and I’m wondering why you won’t, or can’t tell me.
…
Okay, I’ll stop asking. I’m just curious is all.
…
You know, after you convinced me and Candace to see a therapist, they made sure to talk to us about constant open communication. I think that applies to all the people in our lives.
…
…
I guess if it’s not serious, I’ll absolutely take your word for it.
…
No problem, I got you. I will not butt into your problems anymore.
…
I believe you. We all have our issues that bother us. Like me, it’s these little things that get you. Every day at the office, they put in two things of coffee, decaf and normal. And every day I wind up so depressed because they aren’t labelling which is which.
Like how ridiculous is this. It’s so simple. Just put down tape and label one DECAF, and the other NORMAL. They mess up my entire day because they’re just too damn lazy. These people I’ve hired are really idiots, I need to fire some people if I want to get some damn coffee in the morning.
…
No! What, I’m kidding, I’m kidding! Can’t you take a joke? Why are you so stupid?
…
You make a big deal out of nothing. I’m the only one who can help you be normal.
…
…
Really I was kidding! I’m obviously not going to fire anyone because they keep deciding to sabotage me. 
I’m just saying that it isn’t that hard to think of others and have some kind of awareness of what they want! If they see that I’m constantly upset that I don’t have the right coffee, then why wouldn’t they put two and two together and think that it’s your fault. You brought this on yourself. There’s only one way out. 
…
Are you sure everything’s okay? You look pale.
…
It’s been quiet here for so long. Where did all the noise go? Why are you so empty?
…
…
Okay, just let me know if you need anything. I’m here for you.
…
I’ll always be willing to repay the favor that you did me and Candace.
…
Those were really intense times.
I can’t believe it’s been only two years since then
