Oh my god have I missed you so much. 
…
No YOU are the best, I don’t know how I’ve been going on with my life without you here with me. So how’s the non-profit? You’re finally getting to save the world!
…
No shit! Planned Parenthood? That’s amazing! I can’t think of a better organization that you could be working for.
…
Well you know it’s kind of amazing how many women think the country would be better off without organizations like Planned Parenthood. What the fuck is up with them? 
Like, you’re a woman, you should know better, but so many women out there are actually just stupid, and they are part of the problem.
…
Well I mean, yeah, it’s totally the fault of all those lawmakers. You’re right, it’s probably better to blame them than anyone else. They think they can speak for women and how to control their bodies. It’s ridiculous.
…
I just wish there was a way to show them all how idiotic they were being. Feminism is their way out of these situations. I just wish I could talk to more of them, make them see. It’s just ridiculous.
…
…
But you know what else is ridiculous? This new job that I’m working at. Have I told you about it?
…
You’ll get a kick out of this. I started working at this company that does web search optimization for a handful of clients. 
…
Exactly! I am the one who now controls the internet! Bow before me!
…
Well our biggest client is this new advertising firm that’s trying to establish itself as a name for “undiscovered” models. They focus their advertising in smaller rural areas to get people to travel to satellite locations for photoshoots.
…
So what I’m doing is trying to make it so that whenever someone starts searching for things like “beautiful,” “perfect,” “skinny,” or anything like that, this agency ends up coming to the top of the list.
…
I mean, I need a job, and this is what I can do. It’s not like I’m the one taking advantage of anyone.
…
The target demographic are younger men and women, but it seems like women are more interested in trying to find modelling careers, it’s actually kind of weird. I thought maybe it would be an equal spread.
…
…
I mean, it’s not like this is hurting anyone! These people are making the choice to go to these agencies and try for the best. 
It’s not my fault if society has skewed conception of beauty. When push comes to shove I need to prioritize myself and make sure I have money to put food on the table. I do what I can to fight for equal rights, but it’s not like I can let it affect my ability to live.
…
I guess...I guess that is fucked up. I’m sorry, thank you for pointing that out. I’ll try to do better, sometimes I’m just short-sighted and I don’t think.
…
People need to take responsibility for themselves. It’s not my job to hold everyone’s hands and make sure they don’t hurt themselves. If people didn’t want to be taken advantage of then they’d be smarter.
…
…
I will say this for sure, this place is amazing! I had heard that the atmosphere was nice, but this is beyond what I could imagine.
…
Yeah, some people are just really good at designing these kinds of places. I wish I could be that talented. 
…
You’re too nice to me. Oh my god, do you remember that time we went camping and we took that picture of the bear invading our campground? Hold on let me find it.
Where the hell is that picture? Hold, on, I NEED to find it.
