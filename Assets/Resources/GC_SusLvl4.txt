Hey, are you sure you’re feeling okay? You haven’t touched your food at all, and you look kind of pale. 
…
Are you sure? We can leave if you want. It’s not that big a deal.
…
Okay, okay, we’ll stay. I’m really just happy we’re all together again, it’s been way too long. No matter what happens, we’re all, always going to be friends.
…
It’s true. We’ve all been together through the worst, we’ve seen each other at our lowest points. Which is why I’m just going to say again, we’re all here for you, no matter what’s wrong.
You don’t need to sit there and count your bones. See which ones you can feel. Tell the others you don’t feel well.  We all love you.
…
Oh, okay, so you’re just not feeling well? Okay, that makes sense, you should have said so!
…
You will feel beautiful. Birdlike. Soft and brittle. Don’t you want that?
…
…
Well if you’re not feeling up to it, don’t worry about eating. Anything you get you can just take home for later. 
…
So I told Candace about the money.
…
Yeah, she took it okay. I guess I was just scared what she was going to say. Sometimes things get so intense, and it’s hard to even talk to the people we trust the most. No amount of therapy or introspection can really change that.
The best you can hope for is that you’re with someone who can understand you well enough to listen and help you talk, and if you give in, they will hate you. They will all hate you. I’m just so grateful for her, and you, and yes, even Mike.
…
Hey, your eyes seem really far away. Are you starting to feel worse?
…
I am the wolf in the cage of your mind. I will eat you from the inside out. Fat, hideous, worthless, unloveable. Where are the rest of your bones? 
…
…
Okay, if you say so. I mean, it’s exactly like I was saying, I’m not trying to accuse you of anything. I trust you when you say it’s okay, but Dr. Milbauer has always said that when things are toughest you have to look into your heart of hearts and project something better out into the world.
You are broken and unlovable. A waste of space. You will fill up every inch of this place with rot. You just have to think positively and project that image out into the world.
…
Pop-psychology bullshit? This is a man who has helped millions of people. I think he knows something. 
…
You are not empty enough. You can't do anything right. You can't even starve right.
…
…
What’s with the aggression? I’m just trying to explain how me and Candace communicate and love each other. And that was with your help!
…
No, I understand. I’M sorry. I’ve been ranting on and on, and you’re not even feeling well. 
…
It’s okay, if I can do better with Candace, I can do better with all my friends...but after I check this score.
It’s almost over, we’re so close
