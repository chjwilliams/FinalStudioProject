Sorry about that. I have a friend updating me on a football game right now. I’ve got a little bit of money riding on this.
…
Well, we can keep it between us, this is my money after all.
…
No, please don’t, she’ll kill me! Come on we’re friends! We can keep secrets together, right?
…
Okay okay, I’ll make sure to tell her. By the way, is there anything wrong with your food? You’ve barely touched it. It’s important to healthy right now since you’re starting at a new job. The stress of it all can be a killer, and probably the best thing you can do is have a well balanced diet.
…
Okay okay! I get it, I trust you know what’s best for you, I won’t lecture you anymore.
…
You need to make sure that you’re eating three meals a day. If you’re not following a proper diet than you might as well say goodbye to your health. Remember the body's a temple and must be treated like one!

…
You know maybe I SHOULD have been a doctor! I might be able to put this brain to some good use rather than wasting it as a regional manager for this shit sales agency. People tell you that your biology degree will take you places, but there’s not much of a need for it outside medicine.
…
I mean, I could have gone to work for the city, but that would have taken years to get the kind of money I’m making now. I needed to make sure I could provide for Candace and the baby.
…
Well I mean, if the girls has as much willpower as you do then maybe I could have had the city job. I swear, the amount of money we spend on groceries is monstrous. Breakfast food, lunch meats, dinner, snacks, desserts, for every single day of the week. Fresh fruits, organic food, locally grown, it’s like all my financial decisions are made at the grocery store. It’d be easier if we all just stopped eating.
…
I mean, no of course I don’t mean that. I’m sorry, I was just joking.
…
Like, how much does a person REALLY need to eat. Candace always wants to cook these huge dinners, and I mean, I’m grateful, but I also think she’s fattening me up. I just hope she doesn’t do this to our kid as well!
…
…
It’s just that we need to be smarter with our food. Even you! You could probably stand to eat some of Candace’s meals. Get some meat on your bones! I remember when I was a kid, my abuela used to sit there and just PILE food on my plate. There were MOUNDS of it. 
But then, I was a growing boy! Now that we’re adults we have to be more mindful of what we’re eating and what we’re NOT eating.
…
Hey I didn’t mean to make you mad. Are you sure everything’s okay?
…
Make sure you order a lot here! Dinner and dessert are on me tonight, so I don’t want you holding back. 
…
…
I just want us to have a good time tonight. It’s been years since we’ve all been together like this.
…
I know I really missed you too! You were so supportive of me and Candace when we hit that rough patch. We wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for you.
…
We love you too. Oh no! Sports update coming in! I need to check this out.
Come on! How could you mess that up! That was a terrible call.”
