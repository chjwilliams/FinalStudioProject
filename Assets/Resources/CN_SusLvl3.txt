That’s right! We were going to call it Muffins! Here at Muffins, the drinks are always well priced, and the muffins are always baking.
…
God, it WAS bad. But hey, like Billy Joel says, “dream on, but don’t imagine they’ll all come true.”
…
I think we’ve done pretty well for ourselves to be honest. We all seem to be doing really well.
…
I’m proud of us too. But are you sure everything's okay? I’ve just had the weirdest feeling all night that something is wrong. You haven’t touched your food at all. Are you feeling sick?
I’m not trying to pry, it’s probably nothing, probably just my imagination, I just can’t shake the feeling that you’re lying to me. I get these feelings sometimes, I always know when something is wrong.
…
That makes me feel better. I guess sometimes my feelings are wrong.
…
Can you hear me? There are teeth marks on this bread who did this? Who would take a bite and just put the bread back?
…
…
Oh! Do you remember Helen and Marie from school? Remember that cover band they had?
…
YES. And apparently not only are they still together, but they have a show only 2 hours from here. We should absolutely go. We can make a mini road-trip out of it!
…
Oh no! That ruins everything! Are you sure you can’t call out of work? I mean, it’s not like if you miss one day then the whole organization will crumble.
I’m sure you can get out of work if you really want too! Please please care enough about me to go. But no you only care about yourself try to get off! It would be so much fun.
…
Okay, that’s fine. I understand, especially since you’re at a new job.
…
There are teeth marks on the edge of your brain. Some wolf that’s been trying to gnaw its way out. 
…
…
It really bothers me the way that as we get older people just can’t seem to find time for each other. I’m not blaming you! I’m saying in general that people seem to be so much more preoccupied with their own lives as they get older.
You’d think that they’d learn a little empathy after a while. I’m the only one that can help you. I’m the only one that can save you. It just seems like our whole generation should know better.
…
I mean, yeah, we all have a lot more responsibilities. It would make sense that we drift apart.
…
I am safe and warm. I am velvet absolution.
…
…
I guess either way it’s not the end of the world. We’ll always make times like these. I’m going to have to find an army of babysitters.
…
Yes! Perfect then we’ll all have time to finally take over the world.
…
I’m sure we can find a place for them as servants.
Just think of how much better the world would be
